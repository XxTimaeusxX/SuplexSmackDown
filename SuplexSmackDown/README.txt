Walkthrough:
The player starts in El Cohete’s office, the “Human Resource”, and learns the general movement mechanics before moving into the rest of the office. Move throughout the office as employees try to stop you from leaving work early. As you navigate your way through, the player learns the suplex mechanic and the variations. Suplex an employee over the cubicle walls to make your way onto the scaffolding outside. Once outside, the player must platform across hanging platforms and scaffolding. The player learns the “Long Suplex” mechanic and is required to use it to cross certain gaps. Defeat enemies along the way, and use them as movement tools to reach the next platform. Learn and perform “Suplex Cancels” to gain elevation and scale the building. After scaling the side of the building, the player enters the office cafeteria, where they are met with a horde of employees called “The Shoal”. The player must defeat all the enemies to lower “The Shoal’s” health bar. After defeating “The Shoal” the player will then advance to more platforming on the outside of the building, making their way to the boss's office in the vertical slice.
